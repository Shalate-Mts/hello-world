# hello-world
I am a versatile and driven professional with a solid foundation in accountancy and a broad skill set across technology and web development. I graduated with a diploma in Accountancy and pursued an advanced diploma in Financial Markets, which, although incomplete, sparked my interest in both finance and technology. My career began as an accounting trainee, where I gained hands-on experience in Xero, VAT, and UIF computations. I later transitioned into the tech space as a junior developer for a delivery company, creating and integrating a Python-based chatbot with Twilio and payment gateways to enhance customer interactions. Currently, I am working as a WordPress web developer, where I combine my analytical and technical skills to create seamless and user-friendly websites. With a strong background in both accounting and development, I am always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges in the evolving tech landscape.
